# Using Expo for web with Reason React Native

From the [ReasonReact Installation Guide](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/installation#bucklescript), install BuckleScript.

Install packages including the version of [Reason React Native](https://github.com/reasonml-community/bs-react-native) that supports hooks and interop with react-native APIs.

Run `yarn run re:watch` to build Reason files into JS and (in a separate tab), `expo start --web --non-interactive` to start the webpack server via the Expo CLI.
